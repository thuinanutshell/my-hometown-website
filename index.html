            <p>Đắk Nông, anglicized as Daknong, was a former southern mountainous province in the Central Highlands region, the Central of Vietnam. It borders Đắk Lắk to the north, Lâm Đồng to the southeast, Bình Phước and Mondulkiri of Cambodia to the west. It was dissolved and merged with Lâm Đồng province on 12th June, 2025.</p>
            <p>Its name comes from the Đăk Nông River, an upper stream of the Đồng Nai River. Daàk-nông means "River of the Mnong" in Mnong language.</p>
            <p>Đắk Nông is about 500m above sea level in elevation. The terrain is lower in the west. Đắk Nông has large fields and lakes in the south. Đắk Nông has three main river systems: the Ba River, the Srepok (or Sêrêpôk) river (part of the Mekong river basin) and Đồng Nai river demarking the southern border of the Province, with other small rivers and tributaries. Tà Đùng National Park helps to provide riparian zone protection for the Đồng Nai River basin.</p>
            <p>The average temperature is 24 degrees Celsius. The rainy season starts in May and ends in October. The dry season starts in November and ends in April the year after.</p>
